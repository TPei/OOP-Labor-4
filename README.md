OOP Labor 4

This is my version of exercise 4 from OOP Labor FH Flensburg.

This program creates a window with several shapes in a grid.

Shapes include: 
- Square
- Circle
- Pacman
- Triangle
- special shape
- Smiley
- Smiley Pictures

Default number of geometric obejects is 64 resulting in an 8x8 grid. 
Changed number of objects is supported and will automatically resize GridLayout.
